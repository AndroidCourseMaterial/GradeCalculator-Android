<p>What do I need to get on this test to get an "A" in the course?</p>

<p>Weighted Grade Calculator allows you to estimate your final grade in a particular class. Choose from point total or weighted percentages modes to match the way your professor or teacher grades.</p>

<p>Once you've set up the grade components for each course, use the built-in sliders to easily forecast your final grade for different scenarios.</p>

<p>Upgrade to full version through an in-app purchase to allow multiple courses as well as the ability to save courses between app launches.</p>
